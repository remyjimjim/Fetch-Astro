## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

Astro Notes:

- Sometrimes for no known reason (as far as I can tell) Astro straight just gets amnesia. It thinks the page you are perfectly routing to is a page that was previously called the same name as that page...but different case. The fix is nefarious but seems to be: to quit VS Code and start up again and possibly:
- Delete the page and create another page with the same name but maybe wierd case like from 'myfrikkinpage' to 'myFrikkinPage'
- Or not, it might just work from a fresh restart.
- The moral of the story: Just as I've found, if you think you're wrong, re-evaluate, you'll find that you're not wrong, the person who's wrong is the person who shat themself wrong.
